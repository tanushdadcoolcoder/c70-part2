        <p class="text-muted">Berachah Church was founded by C. W. Colgan, an oil company executive, who created it to evangelize Christianity. In 1950, Robert Thieme came to Berachah. Thieme met with the Board of Deacons at the close of his first Sunday service and recommended that they resign immediately. The board accepted this and from that moment on, according to Joe Wall, Thieme "became the dominant leader who brooked no challenge to his authority."[2] Thieme was pastor at Berachah until he retired in 2003, at which time his only son, Robert "Bobby" Thieme III, was elected by the congregation of Berachah to serve as the new pastor.[3]</p>
